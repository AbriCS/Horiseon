# Horiseon Refactor

This is the first portfolio task undertaken for UoB/Trilogy Coding Bootcamp 2021.

The purpose of this task was to review and revise the website code to ensure it meets quality and legislated standards.


## Description

Horiseon is a consultancy company supporting organisations with their social media marketing.
The Coronavirus Pandemic has forced the Horiseon Executive team to revise the efficacy of all their marketing tools
which includes Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) of the company's website.


## Getting Started

The following minimum requirements were secured;

 ```


### Initial steps

- Clarify the acceptance criteria.
- Log into Github
- Create a new Repository  
- Copy the SSH key to the local computer.
